Insied the xcodeproject you will wind 3 subsystems, 1 of them (starships) is implemented with GraphQL and Apollo, 
but doesnt have pagination feature. Other 2 are implemented with basic REST-API, but they do have pagination feature 
(need to mention, that in personView i do have GraphQL request to the planet name).

Regarding security I implemented only FaceID recognition, as it was defined, that i have a choice between pin and biometrics.

My code works for Version 17.0++
